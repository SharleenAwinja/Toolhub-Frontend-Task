# Toolhub Records



## Brief Summary

Toolhub is a community catalog of tools used across many Wiki projects. Its usefulness as such is directly linked to the amount and quality of information it contains. Currently, many tools in Toolhub have missing or incomplete information. While editing this information directly through Toolhub is of course possible, a more streamlined and gamified way with a dedicated UI could make editing faster and more enjoyable.

### Application details

This project creates an application by which toolhub records can be edited using a dedicated UI. The UI has functionality to add new records, edit or delete existing records, view details of a specific record and a search feature to search through the records. It also has a 30 day leaderboard that ranks users according to the number of tools they have added or edited in a month.
